README (text file to add in github repository)

The message to get input for role, NRIC and password will keep appearing until you enter "endprogram" into the system. The message "or type endprogram to exit program" will not be shown to users of our system if our system were to be published in real life, but it is shown now to make it clearer to you (a programmer) when running this program.

When running this program, you will need to run it according to real life processes. Such as when applying for an application, the project Applicant (you) want to apply for must exist first. If HDBManager (you) want to approve or reject HDBOfficer registration for a particular project, the project must exist first and HDBOfficers must apply to register to be an officer for the specific project. (In this case, you will have to log in as HDBOfficers and apply to be an officer for a specific project, before logging in as HDBManager to approve or reject the application). If HDBOfficer wishes to reply to an enquiry, Applicant (you) need to submit enquiries for a particular project first (for the sake of testing this program).

Thank you.
